# Rubik's Cube 3D

This is a 3D Rubik's Cube designed in python 2 using the PyOpenGL library. This 3D Rubik's Cube was designed shortly after the 2D Rubik's Cube was designed. This program also includes many dubious programming practices, and has some rendering issues. It is also a good reference for where I started as a programmer.

## Getting Started

To experiment with this project, you will need to have python 2 and PyOpenGL installed on your computer. Python can be installed from the python website or from your package manager for linux distributions. To install PyOpenGL, run this command in the command line.
```
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
```

Clone the repository to your computer and run:
```
python main.py
```
